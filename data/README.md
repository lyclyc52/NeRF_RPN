# NeRF-RPN Dataset

We release the three main NeRF object detection datasets used in the paper, which are based on [Hypersim](https://github.com/apple/ml-hypersim), [3D-FRONT](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/specials/promotion/alibaba-3d-scene-dataset) & [3D-FUTURE](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/specials/promotion/alibaba-3d-future), and [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/). 

We use the multi-view RGB images from Hypersim and ScanNet for NeRF training and clean up some of the 3D object annotation to fit it to our task. For 3D-FRONT NeRF dataset, we render object-centric multi-view images based on the provided room layouts and furniture models, using [BlenderProc](https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc). 

The released datasets contain posed RGB images, NeRF models, radiance and density extracted from NeRFs, as well as object annotations for each scene. We are also actively expanding & refining the datasets and plan to release more scenes with richer annotations in the future.


## Download
[Google Drive link to the dataset.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q2wwLi6tSXu1hbEkMyfAKKdEEGQKT6pj?usp=sharing) We have temporarily migrated our dataset and models to Google Drive, and previous OneDrive links are expired. You can also download it from [this huggingface link.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lyclyc52/NeRF_RPN/tree/main)

The data is separated into NeRF data and NeRF-RPN training data. You only need the NeRF-RPN data (around 16GB), containing extracted NeRF RGB, density, and bounding box annotations, to reproduce or test our work.


The NeRF training data and models take around 80GB. They are useful for retraining NeRFs, rendering novel views, or re-extracting NeRF features.


## NeRF Data Organization
We use [instant-ngp](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp) to train the NeRF for Hypersim and 3D-FRONT, and [dense depth priors NeRF](https://github.com/barbararoessle/dense_depth_priors_nerf) for ScanNet. Therefore, the NeRF data organization is largely identical to the general NeRF data format.

For instance, you can find the following structure under `hypersim_nerf_data`

```
hypersim_nerf_data
|- ai_001_001
|  └- train
|     |- images
|     |  └-...
|     |- model.msgpack
|     └- transforms.json       
└-...
```

where `model.msgpack` is the instant-ngp NeRF model, `transforms.json` contains camera parameters and poses, and `images` contains the RGB images. 

For 3D-FRONT dataset, you can find an extra `overview` folder containing floor plan and overview images of the scene with bounding boxes annotated. 

For ScanNet, the data is organized as required in [dense depth priors NeRF](https://github.com/barbararoessle/dense_depth_priors_nerf), and the model is under the `checkpoint` folder with `.tar` extension. Please check the original repo for usage.

Note that the instant-ngp models are trained with **an earlier version of instant-ngp** which we forked [here](https://github.com/zymk9/instant-ngp/tree/10f337f3467b3992e1ad48a0851aeb029d6642a3). They also use the CUTLASS MLP so make sure `TCNN_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` is set to 61 when compiling instant-ngp. We also plan to update the models with newer versions of instant-ngp.


## NeRF-RPN Data Organization
NeRF-RPN data contain the dataset split, extracted NeRF density and color, and information of axix-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) and oriented bounding boxes (OBB). For example:

```
front3d_rpn_data
|- aabb
|  |- 3dfront_0000_00.npy
|  └-...
|- features
|  |- 3dfront_0000_00.npz
|  └-...
|- obb
|  |- 3dfront_0000_00.npy
|  └-...
└- 3dfront_split.npz
```

`3dfront_split.npz` contains the train/val/test split used in our paper. `aabb` contains the AABB in each scene, with shape `(N, 6)`, and in the form of `(x_min, y_min, z_min, x_max, y_max, z_max)` for each box. `obb` contains the OBB with yaw angle, with shape `(N, 7)`, in the form of `(x, y, z, w, l, h, theta)`, where $theta$ is the yaw angle about the z axis. 

The extracted NeRF rgb and density are in `features`, which can be loaded with numpy and read the `rgbsigma` entry. The `rgbsigma` values have a shape of `(W, L, H, 4)`, where the last dimension stores `(R, G, B, density)`. `W, L, H` corresponds to scene length in x, y, z axis. Most other attributes stored in the `npz` files are only for visualization purpose and are not used in NeRF-RPN.

**Note that the density for Hypersim has been converted to alpha while others are not.** Also note that instant-ngp and dense depth priors NeRF use different activation functions for density.

So far we only provide OBB data for ScanNet, although you can easily calculate AABB from the original ScanNet dataset. We may also include AABB for ScanNet later.

## Dataset Creation and Tools
Scripts for visualizing the NeRF features and object bounding boxes can be found [here](../nerf_rpn/scripts).

We also provide code and tutorials if you plan to create more NeRF detection dataset from Hypersim, 3D-FRONT, ScanNet, or other indoor multi-view detection datasets. 

Please note that the features extracted by default is in shape of `(W * L * H, 4)`, which should be reshaped and transposed to `(W, L, H, 4)` before used as NeRF-RPN input. The default coordinate system in instant-ngp is y-up and so as the extracted feature grid. For Dense Depth Priors NeRF, the coordinate system is z-up instead. Our NeRF-RPN dataset assumes both the feature grid and boxes are z-up, which means the yaw angles of the boxes are around the z axis.

### Hypersim NeRF dataset creation
Refer to our forked [instant-ngp repo](https://github.com/zymk9/instant-ngp/tree/master/scripts) for NeRF training and feature extraction. Script for generating object bounding boxes is [here](../data/hypersim).

### 3D-FRONT NeRF dataset creation
For 3D-FRONT, first refer to the forked [BlenderProc repo](https://github.com/hjk0918/BlenderProc/tree/main/scripts) for scene configuration, rendering, and object data generation. Then follow the guidance [here](https://github.com/zymk9/instant-ngp/tree/master/scripts) for NeRF training and feature extraction.

### ScanNet NeRF dataset creation
Follow the tutorials [here](./scannet).


## Future Updates
We plan to refine the existing scenes with more accessible NeRF model format and better NeRF quality, etc., and release data of more scenes in the future. We may also release additional annotations and scene data such as object class labels, depth maps, 2D segmentations, and point cloud data, especially for the 3D-FRONT NeRF dataset.
